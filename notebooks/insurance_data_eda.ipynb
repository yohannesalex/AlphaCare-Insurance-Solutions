    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Avg_Ratio:**\n",
    "   - The `Avg_Ratio` reflects the average ratio of premiums paid to claims made for each segment.\n",
    "   - A higher ratio indicates that premiums significantly exceed claims, signaling a profitable group for the insurer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding Count:**\n",
    "   - The `Count` column shows the number of customers in each segment. Segments with a high count represent a substantial customer base, providing opportunities for large-scale strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Profitable Segments:**\n",
    "   - **Province B (Female)** and **Province C (Female)** exhibit the highest `Avg_Ratio` values (2.37 and 2.32, respectively). These groups are highly profitable, as premiums exceed claims by more than double on average.\n",
    "   - These segments could be targeted with premium reductions to attract more customers while maintaining profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Balanced Segments:**\n",
    "   - **Province A (Female)** and **Province C (Male)** have lower `Avg_Ratio` values (1.63 and 1.57, respectively). While these groups are profitable, they are less over-insured compared to others.\n",
    "   - These segments could benefit from stable premiums to ensure customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Marketing Opportunities:**\n",
    "   - **Province B (Male)** has a significant `Avg_Ratio` of 1.72 and a moderate customer base of 156. This segment offers opportunities for expansion through targeted marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **High-Count Segments:**\n",
    "   - Segments with high customer counts, such as **Province A (Female)** with 176 customers, provide opportunities for broader marketing campaigns or customer satisfaction initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimize Marketing for High Avg_Ratio Segments:**\n",
    "   - Focus on **Province B (Female)** and **Province C (Female)** for marketing campaigns that offer premium discounts or loyalty incentives to attract more customers without risking profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retention Strategies for Balanced Segments:**\n",
    "   - Maintain competitive premiums for **Province A (Female)** and **Province C (Male)** to ensure customer retention and explore cross-selling opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expand in Profitable Male Segments:**\n",
    "   - **Province B (Male)** offers potential for growth. Target this group with customized marketing efforts to increase market share.\n"

    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Low-Risk Segments:**\n",
    "   - Low-risk segments are defined as groups where the average total claims (`Avg_Total_Claim`) are significantly below the overall average.\n",
    "   - These groups offer opportunities for premium reductions while maintaining profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Highlighted Low-Risk Segments:**\n",
    "   - The analysis identified the following low-risk segments:\n",
    "     - **Province B (Female):** `Avg_Total_Claim = 904.85`\n",
    "     - **Province C (Female):** `Avg_Total_Claim = 739.59`\n",
    "     - **Province C (Male):** `Avg_Total_Claim = 917.09`\n",
    "   - These segments exhibit lower-than-average total claims and present a good balance between risk and opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparing Premiums:**\n",
    "   - Despite lower claims, the premium values (`Avg_Premium`) for these segments are competitive:\n",
    "     - **Province B (Female):** `Avg_Premium = 1242.24`\n",

    "4. **Count of Customers:**\n",
    "   - Customer counts in these low-risk segments are significant, providing a substantial base for potential premium adjustments:\n",

    "2. **Balanced Premiums in Province B:**\n",
